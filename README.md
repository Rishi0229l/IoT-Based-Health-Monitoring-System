# IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring-System

I developed a health monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from various sensors, including DHT11 (temperature & humidity), 
BMP180 (blood pressure), and an ECG sensor. The data is transmitted to ThingSpeak for storage and visualization. I also built a Java-based website using Spring 
Boot to display live data and charts from ThingSpeak, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.
